I decided to join the Medical Imaging DTP because I really like doing applied research that can have a strong impact in the medical world. After doing my undergraduate 4-year MEng degree in Imperial College, I decided to join CMIC and work on disease progression modelling applied to Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA). PCA is a rare variant of Alzheimer's disease that affects the posterior part of the cerebral cortex. Research about PCA is still in its infancy for we still don't know what the causes are and how to treat this neurodegenerative disorder. My project will hopefully shed a light on understanding the progression of the disease using computational modeling.
